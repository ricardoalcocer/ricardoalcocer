### Hi there 👋

I'm a curious computer scientist always trying to learn new stuff.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel), [Livewire](https://github.com/livewire), [AlpineJS](https://github.com/alpinejs), [Bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma)
- 💬 Ask me about Developer Relations and/or Developer Marketing
- 📫 How to reach me: [My Website](https://alco.rocks)
